*****  HOLOVID  *****

A very BETA example of how to use/view a STRUCTURE SENSOR recording in Volume using Unity.

IMPORTANT: it currently does not work with soft slicing.  This will be added in the future. 
So for now, only hard slicing.


TO USE:

1) Import your video into Unity
2) Select the Holovid game object
3) Find the material assigned to it in it's inspector.
4) Apply your video to the material.
5) play!  ^_^

* Toggle the GUI with space bar
* If the displacement is too high or too low you can adjust it either in said material, or in the GUI slider during play.
